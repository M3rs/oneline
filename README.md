ASCII Fishing

## Play

Built in rust, use `cargo run` to play the game. Sorry, no pre-built binaries set up yet.

## Controls

|Key|Function|
|---|--------|
| q | quit game |
| left/right arrows | move boat (while not casting) |
| up/down/left/right | hook the fish |
| c | toggle casting |
| r | reel in |

When a fish is hooked, press the arrow keys as prompted, then r to reel in the fish.

![key prompt](/res/keys.png?raw=true "key prompt")

If you get the sequence right, it will prompt for "r". Keep pressing it to reel in!

![reel](/res/reel.png?raw=true "reel")

If you mess up, your line breaks and it's game over

## Running the Game

### Windows

Run the EXE

### OSX

You need to make the program executable, see this article on how to [Make a file executable](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/make-a-file-executable-apdd100908f-06b3-4e63-8a87-32e71241bab4/mac).

If OSX is still complaining, you may need to allow the app to run. See this article on how to [Open a Mac app from an unidentified developer](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac)

### Linux

The program should just run, though you may need to make it executable.
